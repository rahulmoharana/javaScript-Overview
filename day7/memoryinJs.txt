There are two type of memory in Js
  1.Stack:
     It stores Primotive data type.
  2.heap:
     It stores Non-primotive data type.

........
let myemail = "moharanarahul466@gmail.com";
let anotheremail = myemail
anotheremail= "anotheremail@gmail.com"
console.log(myemail);
console.log(anotheremail);
  in this case when we asign the value of myemail to anotheremail then Js will not give the real value.It will provide the copy of that value .
  when we console the value of myemail then Js will print moharanarahul466@gmail.com
  but when we console the value of anotheremail then Js will anotheremail@gmail.com.

let user = {
    email:"user.@gmail.com",
    upi: "user",
}
let user2 = user;
user2.upi = "user2";
console.log(user2);//  email:"user.@gmail.com", upi: "user",
console.log(user);  //  email:"user.@gmail.com", upi: "user2",

lets cosider the object in the object the value store in the heap.So the actual value was changed when we asigned  user to user2 variable..
